3. Write warehouses on your sheet
4. Get 3 6 sided dice. (You can use 1 but 3 would make it easier)

## Rounds flow
1. The player rolls the dice
2. The first die determines whats in the shipment (e.g. 3 is aluminum)
3. The second die determines the quantity of the shipment
4. The third die determains if a roll can occur on the fund upevil table (if 5-6 are rolled fund upevil table is used)
5. If your warehouses are full (or you dont want the full shipment) the rest of the resources are passed onto the next player(s) till all resources are taken and/or there is no room for them (or no one wants the materials)
6. The player rolls the dice
7. The first die determines what item is desired (e.g. 2 is lazers)
8. The second die determines how many are desired
9. The third die determines the markets price to buy (e.g. first roll 2, second roll 3 third, roll 6 the market wants lazers and will purchase up to 3 lazers for a rate of 6 credits per lazer)
10. If the player cannot fullfill the market's desire completely it can be passed onto the next player (e.g. the player sell 1 lazer, the market will still want 5 more. This will pass on till either there are no more lazers desired or it gets back to the orignal player)
11. It is the next players turn
